Check command line for arguments
  if none, go to interactive mode
  if one, go to batch mode
    check that file exists/readable

  if -h print simple help

Multi-threading
  for each command on an input line
    fork child process to execute that command
  parent "wait" for all children to finish

Signal handling
  CTRL D - quit after all concurrent commands finish

Parse input line (from batch file or command line)
  remove extra spaces
  handle blank lines (ignore?)
  error check input
    command exists/executable
    <= 512 characters
    errors sent to stderr
  call each command with fork/exec
  
Handle internal commands
  exit - "wait" for all concurrent commands to finish
  cd - "chdir"

Batch Mode
  open file for reading
  echo each command before executing
  exit when quit, CTRL D, or EOF found
  close file
